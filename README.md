Power BI Dashboard

**Overview**
This project involves developing a comprehensive Credit Card Financial Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively. The primary goal is to create an interactive and user-friendly tool that enhances data-driven decision-making.

**Project Objective**
The main objective is to develop a dashboard that:

Processes and visualizes transaction and customer data sourced from a SQL database.
Monitors key performance metrics like revenue, transaction amounts, customer demographics, and other relevant KPIs.
Identifies trends, patterns, and areas of opportunity within credit card operations.
Empowers stakeholders with actionable insights to support strategic decision-making.
Features
Data Integration: Sourced and processed transaction and customer data from a SQL database, ensuring real-time data availability.
Interactive Visualizations: Created dynamic charts and graphs to illustrate trends and key metrics over time, allowing users to interact with and explore the data.
Performance Monitoring: Tracked essential metrics such as weekly revenue, transaction volumes, customer segmentation, and activation rates.
Trend Analysis: Implemented week-over-week (WoW) comparisons to highlight significant changes and trends in the data.
Actionable Insights: Generated insights that guide stakeholders in making informed decisions, such as identifying high-performing customer segments, top credit card types, and key contributing regions.
Data Source
The data used in this project was extracted from a SQL database containing:

**Customer Details:** Including age, income, and gender.
Credit Card Details: Including annual fees, total transaction amounts, and interest earned.
Geographical Data: Focusing on states and regions contributing to overall revenue.
Data Processing
Data was processed using SQL queries in pgAdmin4 and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) within Power BI. Key calculations include:

**Revenue Calculation:** Aggregation of annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned to calculate total revenue.


**Week Number Calculation:** Determined the week number for each transaction date to enable time-based analysis.


**Demographic Segmentation:** Customers were segmented into various age and income groups for more granular insights.

**Revenue Growth**: Observed a 28.8% increase in weekly revenue.

**Customer Engagement** An increase in customer count and transaction volumes.

**Geographical Contribution** States like TX, NY, and CA accounted for 68% of the overall revenue.

**Credit Card Performance**: Blue and Silver credit cards were responsible for 93% of total transactions.

**Total Revenue**: $57M

**Total Interest Earned**: $8M

**Total Transaction Amount**: $46M

**Demographic Contributions**: Male customers contributed $31M to revenue, while female customers contributed $26M.

**Activation and Delinquency Rates**: The overall activation rate was 57.5%, with a delinquency rate of 6.06%.

**Conclusion**
This project showcases the ability to manage and analyze large datasets, derive meaningful insights, and present findings in a visually compelling and accessible format. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for monitoring credit card operations and making informed business decisions, ultimately driving strategic success.
